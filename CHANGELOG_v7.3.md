  'minutes': int,
  'date': String (ISO8601),
  'photoUrl': String?,  // NEW
}
```

**Mould Records:**
```dart
{
  'id': String,
  'number': String,
  'name': String,
  'material': String,
  'cavities': int,
  'cycleTime': double,

}
```

**Checklist Records:**

  'completedBy': String?,
  'createdBy': String,
  'createdAt': String,
}
```

## Service Updates

### PhotoService
**File:** `lib/services/photo_service.dart`

Already included methods (from v7.2):
- `uploadMouldPhoto(String mouldId)` - Upload mould identification photos
- `uploadDowntimePhoto(String downtimeId)` - Upload downtime incident photos

Both methods:
- Use `ImagePicker` to select from gallery
- Compress to 70% quality
- Upload to Firebase Storage
- Return download URL
- Handle errors gracefully

## UI/UX Improvements

### Color Palette
- Primary: #4CC9F0 (Cyan)
- Success: #00D26A (Green)
- Warning: #FFD166 (Yellow)
- Danger: #FF6B6B (Red)
- Info: #9D4EDD (Purple)
- Neutral: #6C757D (Gray)

### Design Patterns
- Consistent 12px border radius for cards
- Gradient backgrounds for headers
- Status-colored borders and badges
- Icon-based visual hierarchy
- Empty states with helpful messages
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

## Navigation Updates

**Role Router** (`lib/screens/role_router.dart`):
- Added Paperwork screen to manager menu
- Positioned between Downtime and Reports/OEE
- Requires level >= 3 (managers/setters)
- Passes username for tracking

## Files Modified

1. `lib/main.dart` - Added checklistsBox initialization
2. `lib/screens/downtime_screen.dart` - Machine selection + photo upload
3. `lib/screens/manage_moulds_screen.dart` - Photo upload + display
4. `lib/screens/planning_screen.dart` - Complete redesign
5. `lib/screens/timeline_screen.dart` - Completion dates
6. `lib/screens/role_router.dart` - Added paperwork navigation

## Files Created

1. `lib/screens/paperwork_screen.dart` - Complete checklist system

## Dependencies

No new dependencies required. All features use existing packages:
- `hive` / `hive_flutter` - Local storage
- `firebase_storage` - Photo storage
- `image_picker` - Photo selection
- `intl` - Date formatting
- `syncfusion_flutter_charts` - Timeline charts
- `uuid` - ID generation

## Migration Notes

### From v7.2 to v7.3

1. **Automatic**: New `checklistsBox` will be created on first launch
2. **Backward Compatible**: Existing downtime and mould records work without changes
3. **Optional Fields**: New photo fields are optional, won't break existing data
4. **No Data Loss**: All existing features remain functional

### Firebase Storage Structure

New storage paths:
- `downtime/{downtimeId}/photo_{timestamp}.{ext}`
- `moulds/{mouldId}/photo_{timestamp}.{ext}`

Existing paths (unchanged):
- `issues/{issueId}/photo_{timestamp}.{ext}`

## Performance Considerations

- Photos compressed to 70% quality before upload
- Thumbnails displayed at 50x50px in lists
- Lazy loading of images with error handling
- Efficient date-based filtering for checklists
- Minimal re-renders with proper state management

## Known Limitations

1. **Photo Storage**: Photos stored in Firebase Storage (requires internet)
2. **Checklist History**: No archive feature (items persist indefinitely)
3. **Bulk Operations**: No bulk complete/delete for checklists
4. **Photo Editing**: No in-app photo editing capabilities
5. **Offline Photos**: Photos require internet connection to upload/view

## Future Enhancements (Not in this release)

- Checklist templates
- Recurring checklist items
- Checklist completion reports
- Photo annotations
- Bulk checklist operations
- Checklist reminders/notifications
- Export checklists to PDF
- Photo gallery view
- Mould photo comparison
