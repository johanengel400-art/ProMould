# Manual Steps Required

## Overview
This document outlines the manual steps needed to complete the ProMould v7.2 setup after the code fixes have been applied.

## Critical Steps (Must Do)

### 1. Install Dependencies
**Why**: The `syncfusion_flutter_gauges` package was added to `pubspec.yaml` but not yet installed.

**Command**:
```bash
cd /workspaces/promould_v7_2
flutter pub get
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Running "flutter pub get" in promould_v7_2...
Resolving dependencies...
+ syncfusion_flutter_gauges 26.1.41
Changed X dependencies!
```

### 2. Verify Code Quality
**Why**: Ensure all Flutter analysis errors are resolved.

**Command**:
```bash
flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos --no-fatal-warnings
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Analyzing promould_v7_2...
No issues found!
```

**If Issues Found**:
- Review the error messages
- Most common issues:
  - Unused imports (can be auto-removed by IDE)
  - Unnecessary null assertions
  - Type mismatches
- Refer to `FIXES_APPLIED.md` for patterns

### 3. Test Compilation
**Why**: Ensure the app builds without errors.

**Command**:
```bash
flutter build apk --debug
# or for iOS:
flutter build ios --debug
```

**Expected Output**:
```
‚úì Built build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk
```

## Recommended Steps

### 4. Run the App
**Why**: Verify all features work as expected.

**Command**:
```bash
flutter run
# or for specific device:
flutter run -d <device_id>
```

**What to Test**:
- See `TESTING_GUIDE.md` for comprehensive testing checklist
- Focus on:
  - Live progress updates
  - Scrap rate displays
  - New dashboard design
  - Timeline card layout
  - Mould change scheduler
  - Quality control features

### 5. Check Background Services
**Why**: Ensure services start correctly and run continuously.

**What to Verify**:
1. Live Progress Service starts on app launch
2. Notification Service starts on app launch
3. Shot counts update every 5 seconds
4. Notifications refresh every 30 seconds

**How to Check**:
- Look for console logs:
  ```
  ‚è±Ô∏è Starting live progress service...
  ‚úÖ Live progress service started
  üîî Starting notification service...
  ‚úÖ Notification service started
  ```

### 6. Test Firebase Sync
**Why**: Ensure data syncs correctly with Firebase.

**What to Test**:
1. Make changes in the app
2. Check Firebase Console for updates
3. Verify changes appear on other devices
4. Test offline mode and sync on reconnect

### 7. Performance Testing
**Why**: Ensure app performs well with real data.

**What to Test**:
1. Add multiple machines and jobs
2. Navigate between screens
3. Check memory usage
4. Monitor for lag or stuttering

## Optional Steps

### 8. Code Cleanup (IDE)
**Why**: Remove any remaining unused imports or variables.

**How**:
- In VS Code: Right-click ‚Üí "Organize Imports"
- In Android Studio: Code ‚Üí Optimize Imports
- Run: `dart fix --apply`

### 9. Format Code
**Why**: Ensure consistent code style.

**Command**:
```bash
flutter format lib/
```

### 10. Update Documentation
**Why**: Keep documentation in sync with code changes.

**Files to Review**:
- `README.md` - Update version number and features list
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Add entry for v7.2
- `FEATURES_V8.md` - Already updated with all features

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "flutter: command not found"
**Solution**: Ensure Flutter is installed and in PATH
```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/flutter/bin"
# or add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
```

### Issue: "Target of URI doesn't exist: package:syncfusion_flutter_gauges"
**Solution**: Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies

### Issue: Build fails with "Gradle error"
**Solution**: 
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk
```

### Issue: "Hive box not found"
**Solution**: Ensure all boxes are opened in `main.dart`:
- usersBox
- floorsBox
- machinesBox
- jobsBox
- mouldsBox
- issuesBox
- inputsBox
- queueBox
- downtimeBox
- checklistsBox
- mouldChangesBox
- qualityInspectionsBox
- qualityHoldsBox

### Issue: Live progress not updating
**Solution**: 
1. Check if service started (look for console log)
2. Verify job has `startTime` and `cycleTime`
3. Check job status is 'Running'
4. Restart app to reinitialize service

### Issue: Scrap rates showing 0%
**Solution**:
1. Ensure `inputsBox` has data
2. Check inputs have `shots` and `scrap` fields
3. Verify machine IDs match between inputs and machines

## Next Steps After Manual Steps

1. ‚úÖ Commit the working code
2. ‚úÖ Push to repository
3. ‚úÖ Create release tag (v7.2)
4. ‚úÖ Deploy to production
5. ‚úÖ Monitor for issues
6. ‚úÖ Gather user feedback

## Support

If you encounter issues not covered here:
1. Check Flutter logs: `flutter logs`
2. Review Firebase Console for sync errors
3. Check Hive database: `Hive.box('boxName').values`
4. Enable debug mode for more verbose logging

## Summary

**Minimum Required Steps**:
1. `flutter pub get`
2. `flutter analyze`
3. `flutter run`

**Time Estimate**: 5-10 minutes

**Difficulty**: Easy (assuming Flutter environment is set up)
